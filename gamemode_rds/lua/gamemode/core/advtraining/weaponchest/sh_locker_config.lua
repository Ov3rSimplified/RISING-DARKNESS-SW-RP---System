So for example the categories pistol, rifle, shotgun tells the code to give a weapon plus ammo, where the category health tells the code to give the player a certain amount of health based upon the configuration.

As for you adding a new weapon, you should simply use one of the pre-defined categories.
The categories are not displayed anywhere! So if your weapon doesn't technically fit into either of the categories, don't worry, it won't be displayed anywhere.
